			<h3>challenge</h3>
			<p>Charity bike rides are a great way for an organization to raise money through individual efforts.  The problem is donations end during the ride&mdash;the most compelling part of the experience.  We needed a way to share the riders' efforts with their donors to compell them to donate more.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="six columns description">
			<h3>solution</h3>
			<p>We created Sagwag to drive donors through social media to an online community where they could experience the ride in real time and make donations to give the rider the push they needed.  Using an integrated team made up of myself and two designers, we used close collaboration and an iterative process to crank out an alpha release within a 3 week cycle.</p>

		<div class="six columns description">
			<h3>the result</h3>
			<p>We tested Sagwag out as an alpha release during the Courage Classic, a three-day  charity ride that benefits the Childrenâ€™s Hospital. The riders that activated their social networks were able to raise an additional 20% in pledges on the day of the event through Sagwag.</p>

			<h3>my role</h3>
			<p>For this fast-turnaround project I acted in multiple roles as UX architect, project manager and rails developer.  The amazing UI design was created by Jerry Stafford, Art Director and Ben Wallace, designer, at Pure.</p>

				<h3>approach</h3>
				<p>Working through several iterations on a whiteboard, we focused on two major drivers:  how can we capture the excitement of the rider's experience online and how to motivate users to join and donate.</p>

				<h3>technology</h3>
				<p>Built using Ruby on Rails for rapid development, we leveraged the Facebook API for authentication and the broadcasting of signup and donation events.  The Geoloci API was used for real-time geolocation of the rider and firing events when the rider reached the toughest part of the ascent.</p>
